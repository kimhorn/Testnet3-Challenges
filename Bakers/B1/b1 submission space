Notes: The Node has been running nonstop for the whole period (more than 30 days). 
I this period we had a local network outage and the node lost internet connecivity. 
When the internet connection was reestablished, the node reconnected to the Concordium peers and completed a catchup.
Due to this, the uptime on the Concordium Dashboard was reset and did not show the full uptime
